# Lesson 2: Getting Familiar with Python

**To start this lesson, students should**:

* Have Python and Sublime Text 2 set up on their computer.
* Be familiar with the terminal/command prompt, how to navigate around with it, and how to run Python files from it.
* Have a basic understanding of variables, control flow, and functions (it's okay if you learned this in different languages).
* Have experience putting together the concepts above to form coherent programs.

**By completing this lesson, students will**:

* Gain an understanding of variables, functions, and control flow statements in Python and how they work in Python as opposed to other languages.
* Get practice using control flow to write programs that follow a logical flow in Python.
* Be able to construct basic programs in Python and run them.

Before we start this lesson, I'm assuming that you have already done a fair share of basic programming. Therefore, I may go through a couple of concepts fairly quickly without slowing down to explain them. If any of this is confusing, feel free to ask a mentor.

## Some Python Basics

Before we start doing any coding ourselves, look at the following block of Python code:

    a = 0
    while a < 20:
        a = a + 2
        if a == 12:
            print("I'm skipping this number because I don't like it.")
        else:
            print(a)

You might have seen this code already if you were reading the course requirements of this class, but let's take a closer look at it. Even if you haven't coded in Python before, you might still be able to tell roughly what the code is doing and what it will print out. Feel free to paste all this code into the helloworld.py file from the last lesson and run the file again in the terminal (using `python helloworld.py`) to see for sure what it prints.

Even though you might have been able to tell what was going to print out, you might have also noticed that there are some differences between how this code looks and how code looks in other languages you may have used in the past.

Let's look at a couple of these differences.

### Variables

If you've coded in most other languages besides python, this line probably looks pretty weird to you.

    a = 0

No, this isn't the middle of the program where `a` has already been defined earlier. This is actually just how you define variables in Python. You might be thinking: "shouldn't it look something like this?":

    int a = 0;

Or maybe this:

    var a = 0;

Well, yes, if we're using Java or most other languages, but Python is what we call **dynamically typed**. This means that Python is able to figure out what type of each variable is without you ever having to say so in the code. In fact, if I wanted to, I could even do something like this:

    a = 0
    a = "yolo swag"
    a = False

*and the code would still work*. Unlike Java, for example, variables are allowed to change type as the program runs. Pretty neat!

### Control Flow

> If you haven't heard the term "control flow" before, it's a general term for understanding while loops, if/else statements, for loops, and how they all fit together to determine the order that the code will run in.

#### Conditionals

Looking at these parts of the code:

    while a < 20:
    ...
        if a == 12:

You'll probably notice something very quickly. *No parentheses!* Yes, in Python, we don't need parentheses for our if or while loops. We just need the **condition** (the part of the statement that's either true or false) and a colon.

#### Indentation

The other thing you might notice is the lack of brackets for our while, if, and else statements. If you've used other languages, you'd probably be used to seeing something more like this:

    a = 0
    while a < 20: {
        a = a + 2
        if a == 12: {
            print("I'm skipping this number because I don't like it.")
        } else: {
            print(a)
        }
    }

> (this code doesn't work, by the way - brackets don't mean the same thing in Python as they do in many other languages)

The reason for the lack of brackets is that **Python relies on indentation instead of brackets** to figure out what code belongs to which statement.  

For example, 

    a = 0
    while a < 20:

the above lines of code are not indented at all because they are not inside of any statements. On the other hand, these lines:

        a = a + 2
        if a == 12:

are indented once since they are inside of the while loop, but not any other statements. Since they are inside of **one** statement, they are indented **one** time. On the other hand, this line of code:

            print("I'm skipping this number because I don't like it.")

is indented **two** times since it is inside both the while loop and if statement. The extra indentation serves as a replacement for the opening bracket that would have come after the if statement. Likewise, the following line:

        else:

is indented only **one** time, meaning that it is only inside the while loop, not the if statement, and it, in a similar way, serves as a replacement for the closing bracket that would have come before the else statement. **Therefore, it signifies the end of the if statement**.

The next line:

            print(a)

if you haven't guessed already, is indented 2 times since it is inside both the while loop and the else statement.

#### For Loops

We didn't look at for loops until now because they're very different than for loops in other languages. Here's an example of code you can try running:

    for i in range(10):
        print(i)

This looks very different from for loops in most other languages! Here's the Java equivalent of the above code:

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }

When you run the code, you'll see that, like the Java code above, it will print the numbers 0-9. This is because the `range(10)` function defines that the for loop will go up to **but not including** the number in the parentheses, 10, running pretty much the same way a regular for loop runs.

### Readability

One of the biggest differences in Python compared to other languages is its *readability* - it looks more similar to English than any other coding language out there. Even looking at the above code for the Python for loop versus the Java for loop, you can tell that someone who has never coded before would be much more likely to understand the Python one. That was very intentional, and a big reason why so many people are using Python recently. It's also one of the main reasons why we're using it in this class.

## Let's get started with some coding

Now for the part that many of you have been waiting for! Let's get into some coding. Remember what we did last lesson when we created a Python file? We're going to do that again now and write our code there.

Just to remind you if you forgot how: go ahead and open up the terminal again and navigate to a folder where you want to write some code using `cd`. Once you're in a folder where you'd like to write some code, type `subl tictactoe.py` in the terminal. This will open up Sublime Text and create a file called "tictactoe.py" for you to write your code in.

> Remember, the way to use cd is to type: `cd foldername` where foldername is the folder you'd like to change into. You can use `cd ..` to go out of the folder you're currently in.

### Tic Tac Toe

Now, we're going to try our first exercise.  

In your tictactoe.py file, write code to print out a Tic Tac Toe board that looks like this:

      |  |
    --------
      |  |
    --------
      |  |  

> **Hint**: to print things in Python, use the `print` function. For example, `print("yolo")`

Once you're ready to test your code, go ahead and run your tictactoe.py program the same way we ran our helloworld.py program in the last lesson.

Just to review, go to the terminal and make sure you're in the same directory that tictactoe.py is in.

> **Reminder**: use `ls` to list the files in your current directory and `pwd` to list the current directory you're in.

Make sure you saved your sublime text file ("command-s"). Then type the following command:

    python tictactoe.py

You should see the output of our code (or potentially an error). If it didn't work exactly how you wanted, go ahead and repeat this process until you've got it.

### I'm Awesome x 100

Once you're done with that, we can move on to the next exercise. Create another file called imawesome.py using the same steps we used in the above exercise, then do the following:

Write a program that prints out "\*your name\* is awesome!" 100 times. Then run it the same way we ran the last program (remember to save first!) Here's an example of what my program looked like when I ran it:

![I'm awesome](imawesome.png)

> **Hint**: Try using a for loop. (Look at the code earlier in this lesson for a good example.)
> **Challenge**: If you used a for loop, try doing this again with a while loop.

### Even Odd

Great job! You know the drill now - make a new file (you can call it whatever you want) and try the next problem:

Write a program that prints out the numbers 0 through 30 followed by whether that number is even or odd. Here's what the output should look like:

    0
    even
    1
    odd
    2
    even
    ...
    28
    even
    29
    odd
    30
    even

> **Hints:**
> For loops will be useful again here.
> **Your code should not involve over 5 lines of print statements**.
> If you're thinking about how you could figure out if a number is even or odd, try the mod operator (%). This operator gives the remainder of one number divided by another. For example: 6 % 2 = 0, 7 % 2 = 1.

### Even Odd, Part 2

This next one is very similar to the last exercise, but a bit different. 

This time, we will print numbers from 0-66 followed by if the number is even or odd but have the number increase by 3 each time instead of 1. You can do this with a for loop, but for the sake of this exercise, try it with a while loop. Here's an example of what your output should look like:

    0
    even
    3
    odd
    6
    even
    ...
    60
    even
    63
    odd
    66
    even

> **Hint:** Looking at the code sample I gave in the very beggining of the lesson might be helpful here.

### Fizzbuzz

Okay, this next one might be a bit tricky. Here's what we're going to do:  

Write a program that prints the numbers 0 to 100. However, on the numbers that are divisible by 3, print "fizz" instead of the number. On the numbers that are divisible by 5, print "buzz" instead of the number. And on the numbers that are divisible by both 3 **and** 5 print "fizzbuzz" instead of the number. Here's what your output should look like:

    fizzbuzz
    1
    2
    fizz
    4
    buzz
    fizz
    7
    8
    fizz
    buzz
    11
    fizz
    ...
    88
    89
    fizzbuzz
    91
    92
    fizz
    94
    buzz
    fizz
    97
    98
    fizz
    buzz

**Hint:** Think about how "if, else if, and else" statements might be useful here. Below is an example of what these statements look like in Python. In Python "elif" is used instead of "else if". (Assume `num` has been defined somewhere before this code)

    if num == 3:
        print("eww it's a 3")
    elif num == 42:
        print("YES! it's my favorite number! 42 for the win!!!")
    else:
        print("meh, this number is okay.")

## Functions

We're almost done. There's one last concept for us to get through in this lesson, and that's **functions**. I'm going to assume that if you're doing this lesson, you've already worked with functions, parameters, and return types in the past in some other language, so I'll skip the explanation of what they are.

> If you do need an explanation/review of what functions and parameters are, go [here](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions).

Here's an example of what a function with parameters looks like in Python:

    def count_up(num):
        for i in range(num):
            print(i)
        print("all done!")

Once I define the function like this, I can **call** this function using the following code:

    count_up(5)

which would have the following output:

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    all done!

Notice that I didn't have to define a return type in the function. Python automatically figures it out for you. I could also write a function like this:

    def sum(a, b):
        return a + b

> Yes, I know it would make much more sense to just use addition. This is just an example.

then call it like this:

    mysum = sum(23, 54)
    print(mysum)

and then the output would be:

    77

### Making Fizzbuzz a Function

Okay, last exercise.

Go back to the code you wrote for fizzbuzz. Change it so that you use that code in a function called "fizzbuzz" that takes in a parameter that can specify what number fizzbuzz will go up to. After writing this function, you should be able call the fizzbuzz function like this:

    fizzbuzz(16)

and the output should look like this:

    fizzbuzz
    1
    2
    fizz
    4
    buzz
    fizz
    7
    8
    fizz
    buzz
    11
    fizz
    13
    14
    fizzbuzz
    16

or if you call it like this:

    fizzbuzz(3)

the output would look like this:

    fizzbuzz
    1
    2
    fizz

> **Hint**: Remeber that `range(n)` will go up to, **but not including** the number n.

After you finish that, you're done with Lesson 2! Good job!
